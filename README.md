### Application Description
"ExpenseBud" is a web app for users to easily track their expenses and budget goals. Aside from manual entries of expenses, users could connect with their financial institutions to import transactions via the [Plaid API](https://plaid.com/docs/). Both the expenses and budgets data are visualized in a simple to understand dashboard for high level overview.
